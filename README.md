# Tic-Tac-Toe with Minimax/Alpha-Beta Pruning
Tic-Tac-Toe Project

1. main.py - Including all the helper functions and Minimax/Alpha-Beta Pruning Algorithms


# Usage

1. Run main.py by typing following command in terminal:

    1. If you want to play against the AI with Minimax algorithm, then run:
    ```python
        python3 main.py --method minimax
    ```

    2. If you want to play against the AI with Alpha-Beta Pruning algorithm, then run:
    ```python
        python3 Sudoku_solver.py --method ab-pruning
    ```

1. Remarks: If you choose AC3 as your preferred algorithm, there is a chance that this algorithm may not return a fully solved sudoku. The code will immediately solve the unsolved sudoku with Backtracking + Forward Checking algorithm.
